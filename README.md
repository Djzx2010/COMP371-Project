# README #

## General structure ##

* `doc` is for documentation, report, etc. Create a dir for your team there, e.g., `teamX`, and initialize the report document there.

## Templates ##

* `doc/report/project-report.tex` is the most documented example template in LaTeX, single column, more readable. To be able to compile LaTeX report, install and configure [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org) first (LaTeX backend compiler and styles and packages), then [TeXnicCenter](http://texniccenter.org) (GUI front-end to MikTeX, it will find MikTeX installation when installed after MikTeX). Open `project-report.tcp` project file for TeXnicCenter and compile it using F7 3 times; F5 to preview the PDF.
